# DW6 Test Bed v7 - Cycle 1 - Technical Specification

**Date:** 2025-06-26

## 1. Overview

This cycle is purely for observation and discovery. The objective is to execute a minimal, non-invasive code change to test the end-to-end DW6 workflow, from the Coder stage through to the Deployer stage. The goal is not to implement features, but to meticulously document any flaws, friction points, or areas for improvement in the protocol itself.

## 2. Scope

### In Scope

*   Modifying a single line of code in `src/dw6/main.py`.
*   Adding a `print()` statement as the designated change.
*   Proceeding through the `Coder`, `Validator`, and `Deployer` stages.
*   Logging all observations, flaws, and suggestions for improvement into the `docs/DW6_ISSUES.md` file.

### Out of Scope

*   Implementing any actual improvements to the DW6 protocol during this cycle.
*   Making any changes other than the single specified `print()` statement.

## 3. System Architecture

No changes to the system architecture are planned for this cycle. We are only observing the existing architecture.

## 4. Implementation Plan

1.  **Task:** The Coder will modify the `main` function in `src/dw6/main.py`.
2.  **Change:** Add the line `print("Hello, DW6 Test Bed!")` to the function.
3.  **Task:** The Validator will confirm the change has been made and that existing tests pass.
4.  **Task:** The Deployer will simulate a deployment, which in the current protocol involves committing and pushing the change.
5.  **Task:** At every step, we will carefully observe the agent's behavior and the protocol's logic, logging findings in `docs/DW6_ISSUES.md`.

## 5. Questions & Assumptions

*   **Assumption:** The current test suite is sufficient to pass for this minor change.
*   **Question:** How will the system handle the `Validator` stage if the tests are trivial? (This is a key point to observe).
*   **Question:** What actions will the `Deployer` take? Is it just a Git push, or is there more to it? (Another key observation point).
