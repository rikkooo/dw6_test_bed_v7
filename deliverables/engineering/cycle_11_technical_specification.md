# Requirement: 11

## 1. High-Level Goal

Create a new CLI command, dw6 meta-req "<description>", to allow the user to formally register an improvement requirement for the DW6 protocol itself. This command will append the requirement to a new, simple, append-only log file named meta_requirements.log. The system will be designed to process these requirements sequentially.

## 2. Guiding Principles

**Working Philosophy:** We always look to granularize projects into small, atomic requirements and sub-requirements. The more granular the requirement, the easier it is to scope, implement, test, and validate. This iterative approach minimizes risk and ensures steady, verifiable progress.
