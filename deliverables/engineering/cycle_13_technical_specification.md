# Requirement: 13

## 1. High-Level Goal

Fix a critical bug in the test suite where a test fixture (cleanup_log_file) is incorrectly configured with autouse=True, causing it to delete the production meta_requirements.log file. The fix involves removing autouse=True and applying the fixture only to the specific tests that require it.

## 2. Guiding Principles

**Working Philosophy:** We always look to granularize projects into small, atomic requirements and sub-requirements. The more granular the requirement, the easier it is to scope, implement, test, and validate. This iterative approach minimizes risk and ensures steady, verifiable progress.
