# Requirement: 16

## 1. High-Level Goal

Implement a prompt augmentation system. This system will pre-process the initial user request, enriching it with historical context, project state, and structural formatting before it is passed to the Engineer stage.

## 2. Guiding Principles

**Working Philosophy:** We always look to granularize projects into small, atomic requirements and sub-requirements. The more granular the requirement, the easier it is to scope, implement, test, and validate. This iterative approach minimizes risk and ensures steady, verifiable progress.
