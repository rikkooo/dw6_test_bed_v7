# Requirement: 14

## 1. High-Level Goal

Re-introduce the Researcher stage into the DW6 workflow. The new stage order will be Engineer -> Researcher -> Coder -> Validator -> Deployer. The Researcher stage will have its own set of allowed commands (e.g., search_web, read_url_content) and will be required to produce a research report in deliverables/research/ as its exit criteria.

## 2. Guiding Principles

**Working Philosophy:** We always look to granularize projects into small, atomic requirements and sub-requirements. The more granular the requirement, the easier it is to scope, implement, test, and validate. This iterative approach minimizes risk and ensures steady, verifiable progress.
