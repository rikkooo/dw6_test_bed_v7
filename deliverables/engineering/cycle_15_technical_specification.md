# Requirement: 15

## 1. High-Level Goal

Fix the do command. It should act as a pure authorization gatekeeper, not an executor. It must only validate the intended command against the Governors rules and then exit. It must not attempt to execute the command itself.

## 2. Guiding Principles

**Working Philosophy:** We always look to granularize projects into small, atomic requirements and sub-requirements. The more granular the requirement, the easier it is to scope, implement, test, and validate. This iterative approach minimizes risk and ensures steady, verifiable progress.
