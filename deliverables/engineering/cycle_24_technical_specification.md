# Requirement: 24

## 1. High-Level Goal

Fix DW6: Grant Engineer permission for meta-req and allow reverting from the Engineer stage.

## 2. Guiding Principles

**Working Philosophy:** We always look to granularize projects into small, atomic requirements and sub-requirements. The more granular the requirement, the easier it is to scope, implement, test, and validate. This iterative approach minimizes risk and ensures steady, verifiable progress.
