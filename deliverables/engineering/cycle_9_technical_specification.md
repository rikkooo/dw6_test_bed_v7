# Requirement: 8

## 1. High-Level Goal

Implement a Governor class within the state_manager.py module. This class will be the single authority on stage transitions. The dw6 approve command will now send a request to the Governor. The Governor will only approve the transition if all exit criteria for the current stage are met (e.g., for the Engineer stage, a technical specification file must exist).

## 2. Guiding Principles

**Working Philosophy:** We always look to granularize projects into small, atomic requirements and sub-requirements. The more granular the requirement, the easier it is to scope, implement, test, and validate. This iterative approach minimizes risk and ensures steady, verifiable progress.
