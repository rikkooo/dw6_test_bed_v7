# Research Report: Testing FastAPI MCP Server (Cycle 23)

## 1. Research Objective

The objective of this research cycle was to identify the most effective approaches for testing the newly implemented FastAPI-based MCP server, ensuring its functionality, reliability, and correct behavior.

## 2. Research Process

1. Reviewed the official FastAPI testing documentation.
2. Analyzed community best practices for testing FastAPI applications.
3. Identified appropriate testing methodologies specifically relevant to our MCP server implementation.

## 3. Findings

### 3.1 TestClient

FastAPI provides a `TestClient` class that allows for testing API endpoints without running an actual server:

```python
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from src.dw6.mcp_server import app  # Our FastAPI application

client = TestClient(app)

def test_root_endpoint():
    response = client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "DW6 MCP Server is running."}
```

Key advantages of this approach:
- No need for a running server, making tests faster and more reliable
- Tests execute synchronously, simplifying test writing and debugging
- Compatible with standard pytest fixtures and assertions

### 3.2 Pytest Fixtures

Utilizing pytest fixtures would significantly enhance our testing workflow:

```python
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from src.dw6.mcp_server import app

@pytest.fixture
def client():
    return TestClient(app)

def test_get_state_context(client):
    response = client.get("/context/state")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    # Additional assertions for response content
```

Fixtures recommended for our MCP server testing:
- `client`: A TestClient instance for the FastAPI app
- `mock_state_file`: Temporary workflow state file with controlled content
- `mock_git_repo`: Mock Git repository state for predictable test results
- `mock_requirements_file`: Temporary meta-requirements log with predefined content

### 3.3 Mocking External Dependencies

Our MCP server depends on external systems (files, Git repository) that should be mocked during tests:

```python
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock

def test_git_provider_with_mocked_repo():
    mock_repo = MagicMock()
    mock_repo.active_branch.name = "test-branch"
    
    with patch("src.dw6.git_handler.get_repo", return_value=mock_repo):
        with patch("src.dw6.git_handler.is_working_directory_clean", return_value=True):
            with patch("src.dw6.git_handler.get_latest_commit_hash", return_value="abc123"):
                response = client.get("/context/git")
                assert response.status_code == 200
                assert response.json() == {
                    "branch": "test-branch",
                    "latest_commit": "abc123",
                    "status": "clean"
                }
```

### 3.4 Testing Error Conditions

Tests should verify that the API handles error cases correctly:

```python
def test_state_provider_missing_file(client):
    # Test with a non-existent workflow state file
    with patch("pathlib.Path.exists", return_value=False):
        response = client.get("/context/state")
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert "error" in response.json()
```

### 3.5 Parametrized Tests

For testing various input scenarios:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("file_exists,expected_result", [
    (True, {"requirements": ["Mock requirement 1", "Mock requirement 2"]}),
    (False, {"requirements": []})
])
def test_requirements_provider(client, file_exists, expected_result):
    with patch("pathlib.Path.exists", return_value=file_exists):
        with patch("pathlib.Path.read_text", return_value="Mock requirement 1\nMock requirement 2"):
            response = client.get("/context/requirements")
            assert response.status_code == 200
            assert response.json() == expected_result
```

## 4. Conclusion

Based on the research, we will implement a comprehensive test suite for our FastAPI MCP server using:

1. **TestClient** from FastAPI for endpoint testing without running a server
2. **Pytest fixtures** for setting up controlled test environments
3. **Mocking** for external dependencies like files and Git repository
4. **Parametrized tests** for covering multiple scenarios efficiently

This approach will ensure our MCP server is thoroughly tested while maintaining test isolation, predictability, and comprehensiveness.
