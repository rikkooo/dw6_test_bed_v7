# Research Report: Prompt Augmentation System (Cycle 16)

## 1. Executive Summary

The investigation into building a "prompt augmentation system" has revealed a more robust and standardized approach: **Context Engineering**. Instead of simply pre-pending text to a prompt, we will build a system that provides context to the AI model through a dedicated, open-source protocol. 

The key technology to achieve this is the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, an open standard developed by Anthropic. The AI assistant (Cascade) is already an MCP client. Our task is to build a custom MCP server that exposes our project's specific context.

This approach is superior to basic prompt injection as it is more scalable, secure, and aligns with industry best practices for building agentic AI systems.

## 2. Research Findings

### 2.1. From Prompt Engineering to Context Engineering

Initial research led to the concept of **Context Engineering**, a discipline focused on architecting the entire information ecosystem an AI model uses. This paradigm distinguishes between two types of context:

*   **Deterministic Context:** Information directly and explicitly provided to the model (e.g., the user's prompt, system instructions, files).
*   **Probabilistic Context:** Information the model discovers autonomously by interacting with its tools (e.g., web searches, database queries).

Our "prompt augmentation system" is, in fact, a tool for engineering the deterministic context to better guide the model's discovery of probabilistic context.

### 2.2. The Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The most critical finding is the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. 

*   **What it is:** An open-source, standardized protocol for connecting AI models (clients) to data sources (servers).
*   **How it works:** We will build an **MCP server** that gathers relevant information from our project workspace. The AI assistant, which is already an **MCP client**, will connect to this server to retrieve context.
*   **Advantages:** This client-server architecture is more robust, secure, and maintainable than ad-hoc prompt modification scripts. It allows the AI to pull context dynamically as needed.

### 2.3. Pre-Built Components

Anthropic and the open-source community provide pre-built MCP servers for common tools like Git, GitHub, and various databases. This is a significant accelerator, as we can leverage these existing components and focus on building the logic for our specific project context.

## 3. Proposed Technical Solution

Based on this research, the plan is as follows:

1.  **Develop a custom MCP Server:** This server will be a Python application.
2.  **Implement Context Providers:** Within the server, create modules responsible for gathering specific pieces of context:
    *   `StateProvider`: Reads `logs/workflow_state.txt` to determine the current stage and requirement pointer.
    *   `GitProvider`: Uses the existing `git_handler` to get the latest commit hash, branch, and recent log messages.
    *   `RequirementsProvider`: Reads `logs/meta_requirements.log` to provide the list of open and completed meta-requirements.
3.  **Expose Context:** The MCP server will expose this information through standardized MCP endpoints.
4.  **Integration:** The AI assistant (Cascade) will be configured to connect to this local MCP server, allowing it to access this rich, real-time context during its operations.

This research concludes that building a dedicated MCP server is the most professional and effective path forward for creating our prompt augmentation system.
