# Research Report: GitProvider Implementation (Cycle 19)

## 1. Research Objective

The objective of this research cycle was to investigate the best method for implementing the `GitProvider` class in `mcp_server.py`. The goal was to replace the current hardcoded placeholder values with live data from the project's Git repository by leveraging the existing `git_handler.py` module.

## 2. Research Process

1. **File Examination:** The `view_file_outline` command was used to inspect the contents of `src/dw6/git_handler.py` to identify available functions.
2. **Function Analysis:** Key functions were analyzed to determine their suitability for providing the required context (current branch, latest commit hash, and working directory status).

## 3. Findings

The `git_handler.py` module provides all the necessary functionality to implement the `GitProvider`. The following functions have been identified as critical for this task:

* `get_repo()`: This helper function provides the fundamental `git.Repo` object required for all other Git operations.
* `get_latest_commit_hash()`: This function directly provides the SHA of the most recent commit.
* `is_working_directory_clean()`: This function can be used to determine the status of the repository (clean or dirty).
* The current branch name can be accessed directly via the `active_branch.name` attribute of the `Repo` object returned by `get_repo()`.

## 4. Conclusion

The research is complete. The implementation plan is to import the `git_handler` module into `mcp_server.py`. The `GitProvider.get_context` method will then be updated to call these identified functions and return a dictionary containing the live branch, latest commit hash, and repository status. This will provide a dynamic, real-time view of the project's Git context to the MCP client.
