# Research Report: RequirementsProvider Implementation (Cycle 20)

## 1. Research Objective

The objective of this research cycle was to investigate the `logs/meta_requirements.log` file to inform the implementation of the `RequirementsProvider` class in `mcp_server.py`.

## 2. Research Process

1.  **File Examination:** An attempt was made to view the contents of `logs/meta_requirements.log` using the `view_file_outline` command.
2.  **Error Analysis:** The command failed because the file does not exist.
3.  **Directory Listing:** The `ls logs` command was used to confirm that the file is indeed missing from the `logs` directory.

## 3. Findings

- The `logs/meta_requirements.log` file, which the `RequirementsProvider` is designed to read, is not being generated by our current workflow.
- The existing implementation of the `RequirementsProvider` in `mcp_server.py` is already robust. It correctly handles the absence of the file by returning an empty dictionary, so no code changes are required for the provider itself.
- A new meta-requirement for the DW6 protocol has been discovered: **The workflow must be enhanced to create and maintain a `logs/meta_requirements.log` file.** This will be crucial for providing complete context to the AI assistant.

## 4. Conclusion

The research for the `RequirementsProvider` is complete. While no direct code changes are needed for the provider, we have uncovered a valuable opportunity to improve our protocol's context-awareness. We will proceed through a 'no-op' `Coder` stage for this cycle and log a new meta-requirement to address the missing log file in a future cycle.
