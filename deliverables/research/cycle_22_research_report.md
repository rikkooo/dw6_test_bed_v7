# Research Report: Asynchronous MCP Server Implementation (Cycle 22)

## 1. Research Objective

The objective of this research cycle was to identify the most suitable Python library or framework for transforming our placeholder MCP server into a fully functional, asynchronous server.

## 2. Research Process

1. **Web Search:** A web search was conducted to compare popular asynchronous Python frameworks, including `asyncio`, `aiohttp`, and `FastAPI`.
2. **Documentation Review:** The official documentation for `aiohttp` was reviewed, with a focus on its server implementation examples.
3. **Comparative Analysis:** The features, performance, and developer experience of the candidate frameworks were compared.

## 3. Findings

- **`asyncio`:** While a powerful standard library, using it directly would require significant boilerplate code for HTTP handling and routing, increasing development time and complexity.
- **`aiohttp`:** A mature and capable framework that provides a good balance of control and convenience for building asynchronous applications.
- **`FastAPI`:** A modern, high-performance framework built on Starlette and Uvicorn. It is renowned for its speed, ease of use, and automatic generation of interactive API documentation (Swagger UI).

## 4. Conclusion and Decision

**FastAPI is the chosen framework for implementing the MCP server.**

This decision is based on the following key advantages:

- **Superior Developer Experience:** FastAPI's modern syntax and extensive documentation will accelerate development.
- **High Performance:** It is one of the fastest Python web frameworks available, ensuring our MCP server will be highly responsive.
- **Automatic API Documentation:** The built-in Swagger UI will be invaluable for testing, debugging, and future integration efforts.

The research is complete. We will proceed to the `Coder` stage to implement the MCP server using FastAPI.
