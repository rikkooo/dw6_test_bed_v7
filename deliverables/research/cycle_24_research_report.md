# Research Summary: Fix Engineer Stage Permissions

Research has identified two critical flaws in the DW6 protocol's `Engineer` stage:

1.  The `Engineer` stage lacks permission to add new meta-requirements using `dw6 meta-req`.
2.  The `revert` command does not function from the `Engineer` stage, creating a dead end.

To resolve these issues, the following changes will be implemented:

- **`src/dw6/state_manager.py`:** The `Governor` class will be updated to grant the `Engineer` stage permission to use the `dw6 meta-req` command.
- **`src/dw6/main.py`:** The `revert` command logic will be modified to support reverting from the `Engineer` stage.
